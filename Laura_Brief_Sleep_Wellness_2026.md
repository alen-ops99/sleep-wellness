## Executive Summary

I am building a sleep wellness consulting practice serving three audiences: **luxury hotels**, **elite athletes**, and **corporate executives**. The business leverages my Harvard research credentials and published work on sleep science to offer premium consulting services.

**Current state:** Early stage with a few athlete clients and hotel discussions in progress. Materials (website, presentations) are ready. Now I need systematic outreach to grow.

**Your role:** Help with prospect research, outreach coordination, and administrative support (2-5 hours/week).

3. When someone responds: schedule a 30-min discovery call
4. Track all activity in the spreadsheet

### Administrative (1 hour)
1. Update prospect tracker with status changes
2. Prepare presentation materials for scheduled calls
3. Block my calendar for sleep wellness calls/meetings
